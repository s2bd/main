description: A brief critical review about a renowned Norwegian DJ/producer

At first impression, the video takes viewers on an imaginative journey through time and space, into what appears to be a dystopian scenario. The main actor in focus, Shahab Salehi, roams around urban locations devoid of people or any sign of humanity while wearing a hoodie with a mask on as if to symbolize the solitude he is facing. (That’s right! Most people are falsely deluded by the fact that Alan Walker appears in his music videos. But that is not the case. Keep an eye on the video descriptions always!) With angelic vocals backing up the music, viewers follow on Shahab Salehi’s footsteps as he explores and searches around for someone. Later, it is revealed to be ‘someplace’ that he is looking for.
<br /><br />
Speaking of the music, the main composition is produced and designed by Alan Walker. Iselin Solheim plays a crucial role of being the vocalist for this music video since her voice was able to create the serene voice guiding the background tune. The lyrics are based on ‘Atlantis’ which is a Greek myth about an underwater utopia lost from mankind. Likewise, the audio had been specifically manipulated in order to offer some sort of reverberating ‘underwater’ effect. Overall, the tone of the musical attributes and the environment set up for this particular music video had been creatively and wisely suited for delivering a message to the audience.
<br /><br />
And that explains why that particular music video continues to increase its views per day — there are lots of people listening to it regularly, in an attempt to depart with their own depressions and materialistic problems. The whole team behind Alan Walker’s music videos attempt to produce works that reflect a sign of “hope” in lots of unique dystopian settings.
<br /><br />
On the other hand, Alan Walker produces less than 20% of all the tracks by himself. Yes, it is true! In the world of famous DJs, they hardly have enough time for creating full tracks by themselves. So they hire “ghost producers” which produce most of the tracks for them.
<br /><br />
This is indeed a sad esoteric truth about Alan Walker, that most of the tracks that you listen to are NOT made by him.
<br /><br />
There have been plenty of ethical concerns and debates whether to allow DJs to keep on using ghost producers to earn their name and fame. For the time being, nobody cares as long as they can enjoy high quality music and as for the ghost producers, they are receiving monetary profits to work on and keep their mouths shut about this hidden undercover business.

So next time, make sure you keep these points in mind before assuming that your favorite musical producer/artist (especially if he or she is a DJ) composes and produces all of their music by their own hard-won efforts, triumphs and days spent in getting the tunes to the right shape; they could instead be happily sipping margarita on an Adirondack chair while some unknown maestro deals with the tough job.
<br /><br />
To conclude, let everyone hide their mistakes or shortcuts. Who cares? Have a pleasant life, where everyone goes home with a pleasant smile imprinted on their satisfied faces.
