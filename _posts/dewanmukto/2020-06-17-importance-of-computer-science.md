In this modern era of constantly developing technologies, digital devices are the utmost crucial resources that underpins all of the luxuries and factors of staying synchronized with the rest of the world. Computers are amongst the most ideal examples of such digital devices --- the 21st century miracle machines.

Without computers, we may find it increasingly difficult to navigate through the limits set by the demanding needs of modern lifestyles. And of course, we require a minimum level of basic knowledge about information and communication technology (ICT) in order to calibrate ourselves with the other nations' advancing technology.

What is Computer Science ?
==========================

Computer science, which is also referred to as "computation science" or "computing science", is a study of the algorithmic processes that are under interaction with data (raw information), and that can be classified as a representation of data in the form of computer programs (software applications). To store, manipulate, convey, and implement digital information within the computer universe is a result of the use of specific algorithms via the bridges offset by computer science.

Computer science is not to be confused with "computation science" (*which is another discrete field that relies on advanced computing capabilities to compile and neutralize complex problems*) or "software engineering" (*which is a derivative sector of computer engineering to the systematic development of software*).

Although similar at first glance, computer science and engineering (CSE) is an integrated field combining computer science with computer engineering. CSE is more of a subset of electronics engineering.

The fields of computer science, one of the main scopes of this book, are partitioned into both theoretical and practical disciplines.

We shall have a glimpse at some vital aspects of computer science in the next section.

Career Choices
==============

It is quite hard to imagine the extent of the dependency we have towards technology, more specifically, digital technology.

The greatest influence and the sole role of computer science is "problem-solving", which is an essential skill in real life. People studying within the confines of this subject not only capture details of the design, development and analysis of various software and hardware resources, but also to implement that knowledge and research for a whole plethora of commercial, scientific, and social contexts. Since computers cure problems to serve people, there needs to be proper administration and expertise in order to maintain the safety, security, and care for such devices.

Nonetheless, the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), which is an international platform and organization for computer scientists, has proposed the following list of top ten reasons why we need to study computer science. It is quoted thus :

1.  *Computing is part of everything we do in the 21st century!*
2.  *Having expertise in computing enables you to solve complex, challenging, and intriguing real-life problems.*
3.  *Computing enables you to make a positive difference in this vast world of enthusiasm and competition for success.*
4.  *Computing offers several types of lucrative and luxurious careers.*
5.  *Computing jobs are here to stay, regardless of where you are located.*
6.  *Expertise and skills in computing helps even if your primary career is something else.*
7.  *Computing offers great opportunities for true creativity, inspiration and innovation.*
8.  *Computing has space for both collaborative work as well as individual effort.*
9.  *Computing is a vital part of well-rounded academic preparation, especially ICT skills.*
10. *Future opportunities in computing are without boundaries.*

*Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), Wikipedia*

Plus, computer science is a portal for self-expression of talents, abilities, and highlighting an individual's own merit qualities and reaching out towards a globalized society. Since the field of computer science is one of the fastest growing and highest paying career paths in the world, why should we hesitate from joining this stream of modernization?

Probably one of the most interesting and baffling discoveries of computers is that there are only 2 objects that a digital device has to deal with, to represent anything --- the binary code of 1s and 0s. This is one of the axioms of computers, thus referring to the core of computer science. Similarly, such simple ideas can magnify to great steps for mankind in these computing fields.

Fields and Sectors
==================

Getting to grips with computer science's primary importance, we now move on to a clear definition of the term "computer science".

Computer science (CS) can be considered as an academic discipline, a part of science, and a part of applied science, too.

The total concept of computing and computer science is truly humongous, and it contains a large sum of different fields and creative sectors for professionalism as well as academic careers. These include :

- Mathematical foundations (including coding theory, game theory, graph theory, mathematical logic, and number theory)

- Algorithm design

- Algorithms and data structures (including sequential and simultaneous computing techniques for finding solutions to a wide range of problems)

- Artificial Intelligence (including automated reasoning, computer vision, soft computing, machine learning, evolutionary computing, natural language processing, and robotics)

- Bioinformatics (to store, analyze, and conserve biological data to help in solving problems related to Biology, such as protein folding, function prediction, and phylogeny)

- Communication and security

- Computer architecture and operating systems

- Computer graphics

- Cryptography

- Databases

- Data mining

- Human-computer interaction

- Image processing

- Information visualization

- Programming language theory

- Quantum computing

- Reverse engineering (a type of software engineering)

- Scientific computing

- Software engineering

So, as we have seen in the examples above, computer science is an advanced and newly emerging futuristic field of major careers related to governing the modern way of life. The three fundamental branches of science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology) are all integrated into CS as crucial roles for discovering new methods and inventions for upcoming generations.

We are faced with an entire fleet of opportunities to secure our position worldwide and to establish a modernized approach to society, science, and technology via the means of subjects and fields such as computer science. Hence, everyone is cordially invited to attempt a go at these computing sectors.
