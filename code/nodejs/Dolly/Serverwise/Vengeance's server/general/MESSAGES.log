[Fri May 27 2022 22:27:59]LolQuattro#0125 said: Can you enter my private channel?
[Fri May 27 2022 22:28:43]Muxto#8483 said: All the code runs in a virtual device within my device, so there are lower risks of external threats if I used a web server
[Fri May 27 2022 22:29:08]Muxto#8483 said: No, but I don't need to. <@977262952354828308> can see the msgs.
[Fri May 27 2022 22:29:33]LolQuattro#0125 said: Ok that’s scary
[Fri May 27 2022 22:34:34]LolQuattro#0125 said: I don’t need to
[Fri May 27 2022 22:34:37]Muxto#8483 said: hmmm
[Fri May 27 2022 22:34:42]LolQuattro#0125 said: Because it’s not impacting me negatively
[Fri May 27 2022 22:35:03]LolQuattro#0125 said: I’m still a good person regardless of what porn I watch
[Fri May 27 2022 22:35:13]LolQuattro#0125 said: Get it <@784119755111661569> ?
[Fri May 27 2022 22:35:48]Muxto#8483 said: Aye, but if you ask yourself.... are you truly *pure*?

[Fri May 27 2022 22:36:30]LolQuattro#0125 said: And as for looking at other women I’ll stop once I get a girlfriend or wife
[Fri May 27 2022 22:36:45]LolQuattro#0125 said: Lol
[Fri May 27 2022 22:37:20]Muxto#8483 said: Good. Atleast try to focus on fictional women, so that you don't gaze at real ones.
[Fri May 27 2022 22:38:08]Muxto#8483 said: Also, a cool fact is that the meme fetching algo is based on this package, made by a 🇧🇩 developer!

[Fri May 27 2022 22:40:56]Muxto#8483 said: 🤔
[Fri May 27 2022 22:40:58]LolQuattro#0125 said: Oh wait nvm
[Fri May 27 2022 22:41:00]LolQuattro#0125 said: I know why
[Fri May 27 2022 22:41:12]LolQuattro#0125 said: I didn’t invite it to my private channel
[Fri May 27 2022 22:41:31]Muxto#8483 said: okay
[Fri May 27 2022 22:41:33]Muxto#8483 said: also

[Fri May 27 2022 22:41:59]Muxto#8483 said: you can use aliases for some 'variance'
[Fri May 27 2022 22:42:07]Muxto#8483 said: oh really?
[Fri May 27 2022 22:42:08]LolQuattro#0125 said: You’ve got to make them more intense

[Fri May 27 2022 22:42:58]Muxto#8483 said: <@977262952354828308> can be really powerful
[Fri May 27 2022 22:43:02]Muxto#8483 said: 🤣
[Fri May 27 2022 22:43:05]LolQuattro#0125 said: Oh nice
[Fri May 27 2022 22:43:15]Muxto#8483 said: copy-paste this
[Fri May 27 2022 22:43:19]LolQuattro#0125 said: So there are specific keywords? Or anything goes?
[Fri May 27 2022 22:44:01]Muxto#8483 said: tomorrow I'll add a specific command for hoes. For the timrbeing, suffice with `md waifu` and `md meme <subreddit name>`
[Fri May 27 2022 22:44:13]Muxto#8483 said: keywords : not yet
[Fri May 27 2022 22:44:28]Muxto#8483 said: currently it just fetches images from Reddit
[Fri May 27 2022 22:44:56]LolQuattro#0125 said: Nice
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:01]Muxto#8483 said: `md meme` is like your get-go for custom subreddits
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:03]LolQuattro#0125 said: I’ve got the hang of it
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:09]LolQuattro#0125 said: I’m gonna have some fun with this
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:28]Muxto#8483 said: however, `md meme` on its own will just send a random meme/image
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:34]Muxto#8483 said: okay, as you wish
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:40]LolQuattro#0125 said: Can it do gifs?
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:50]Muxto#8483 said: yes, if the subreddit has them
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:57]Muxto#8483 said: I'll add more sources
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:58]Muxto#8483 said: dw
[Fri May 27 2022 22:46:04]Muxto#8483 said: for now, it's just Reddit
[Fri May 27 2022 22:46:08]LolQuattro#0125 said: Okay
[Fri May 27 2022 22:46:21]LolQuattro#0125 said: Great stuff though bro
[Fri May 27 2022 22:46:31]LolQuattro#0125 said: You’ve managed to create a great bot
[Fri May 27 2022 22:46:34]Muxto#8483 said: note : for `md meme <subreddit>`, you don't need to type the r/
[Fri May 27 2022 22:46:37]Muxto#8483 said: thanks
[Fri May 27 2022 22:46:44]Muxto#8483 said: it has better features coming up
[Fri May 27 2022 22:47:00]Muxto#8483 said: as appreciation, you could atleast read the features
[Fri May 27 2022 22:47:43]LolQuattro#0125 said: I did
[Fri May 27 2022 22:47:54]Muxto#8483 said: In summary,
`md meme` returns a random meme/image
`md meme r/cats` doesn't return anything because of wrong format
`md meme cats` returns random cat images from r/cats
[Fri May 27 2022 22:47:57]Muxto#8483 said: okay
[Fri May 27 2022 22:48:00]Muxto#8483 said: thanks 👍
[Fri May 27 2022 22:48:09]Muxto#8483 said: feel free to suggest any features
[Fri May 27 2022 22:48:38]LolQuattro#0125 said: You need to randomize it more
[Fri May 27 2022 22:48:47]LolQuattro#0125 said: Currently it’s sending similar pics back
[Fri May 27 2022 22:48:53]Muxto#8483 said: `md meme somerandomsubredditthatdoesn'texist` won't return anything because the subreddit doesn't exist
[Fri May 27 2022 22:48:59]Muxto#8483 said: hmm 🤔
[Fri May 27 2022 22:49:02]Muxto#8483 said: okay
[Fri May 27 2022 22:49:03]Muxto#8483 said: noted
[Fri May 27 2022 22:49:34]Muxto#8483 said: I mean... today's the first day of its implementation, so it's gonna take some time to adjust
[Fri May 27 2022 22:49:42]Muxto#8483 said: in the beginning, in the afternoon, I had to struggle with the formatting for 2-3 hours.
[Fri May 27 2022 22:50:16]LolQuattro#0125 said: How does the delete function work again
[Fri May 27 2022 22:50:16]Muxto#8483 said: and ofcourse... in case of emergency, use the `md delete 100` command to instantly erase 100 msgs
[Fri May 27 2022 22:50:25]Muxto#8483 said: what a coincidence!
[Fri May 27 2022 22:50:26]LolQuattro#0125 said: Perfect timing lmao
[Fri May 27 2022 22:50:29]Muxto#8483 said: yeah
[Fri May 27 2022 22:50:40]Muxto#8483 said: i didn't even know what you were about to type!
[Fri May 27 2022 22:50:51]LolQuattro#0125 said: Yeah
[Fri May 27 2022 22:50:59]Muxto#8483 said: md meme murderedbywords

[Fri May 27 2022 22:51:45]Muxto#8483 said: But dw, I'll add currency systems etc
[Fri May 27 2022 22:52:56]Muxto#8483 said: also... the main reason I added this "server invite entry" feature is so that I can enter any server I wish, at will
[Fri May 27 2022 22:53:07]Muxto#8483 said: Especially unknown ones
[Fri May 27 2022 22:53:51]Muxto#8483 said: oh wait...
[Fri May 27 2022 22:54:12]Muxto#8483 said: I realized I had set the non-NSFW setting ON for `md meme`
[Fri May 27 2022 22:54:18]Muxto#8483 said: Oh well, got some time on my hands
[Fri May 27 2022 22:54:26]Muxto#8483 said: gonna work on that NSFW feature then
[Fri May 27 2022 22:55:04]Muxto#8483 said: ```
Good friends always help each other.
Greater friends make NSFW bots.
```
[Fri May 27 2022 22:55:05]Muxto#8483 said: Lol
[Fri May 27 2022 22:55:07]Muxto#8483 said: 😂
[Fri May 27 2022 22:55:12]Muxto#8483 said: Jus' kidding
[Fri May 27 2022 23:08:49]Muxto#8483 said: added new commands! <@523963627913478184>
[Fri May 27 2022 23:09:02]Muxto#8483 said: although you can't see them in the menu (for obvious reasons!)
[Fri May 27 2022 23:09:05]Muxto#8483 said: md help
[Fri May 27 2022 23:09:57]Muxto#8483 said: basically to override the (weak, but still effective against NSFW seekers) non-NSFW mode, you just add a `nsfw` prefix to either `meme` or `animewaifu`
[Fri May 27 2022 23:10:17]Muxto#8483 said: e.g. `md nsfwmeme animegirlsfullynaked` or `md nsfwwaifu`
[Fri May 27 2022 23:10:48]Muxto#8483 said: <@523963627913478184> give it a try and lemme know
[Fri May 27 2022 23:10:58]Muxto#8483 said: Lol, what am I even saying ? XD
[Fri May 27 2022 23:11:11]LolQuattro#0125 said: Wait I’m confused
[Fri May 27 2022 23:11:16]LolQuattro#0125 said: Simplify
[Fri May 27 2022 23:12:39]LolQuattro#0125 said: <@784119755111661569> md sent nsfw stuff even without the prefix
[Fri May 27 2022 23:13:23]Muxto#8483 said: what?
[Fri May 27 2022 23:13:24]Muxto#8483 said: how?
[Fri May 27 2022 23:13:41]Muxto#8483 said: 🤔 I mean.. the anti-NSFW feature is not very strong itself
[Fri May 27 2022 23:13:53]Muxto#8483 said: what was the command?
[Fri May 27 2022 23:14:03]LolQuattro#0125 said: Well I like boobs so I search up md meme boobs or tits or something
[Fri May 27 2022 23:14:15]LolQuattro#0125 said: And they show up
[Fri May 27 2022 23:14:18]Muxto#8483 said: I can already see several, but dunno which one to be specific
[Fri May 27 2022 23:14:48]Muxto#8483 said: I guess I'll just disable all the NSFW subreddit options manually
[Fri May 27 2022 23:14:58]Muxto#8483 said: for the ordinary `md meme` option
[Fri May 27 2022 23:15:02]LolQuattro#0125 said: Ok
[Fri May 27 2022 23:15:13]LolQuattro#0125 said: More work for me then 🤣
[Fri May 27 2022 23:15:26]LolQuattro#0125 said: Tbh I don’t even use discord for nsfw stuff
[Fri May 27 2022 23:15:27]Muxto#8483 said: Lol, you just use `md nsfwmeme`
[Fri May 27 2022 23:15:41]Muxto#8483 said: good, I mean... bad 😳
[Fri May 27 2022 23:15:48]LolQuattro#0125 said: Lol
[Fri May 27 2022 23:16:20]LolQuattro#0125 said: I hope you’re not uncomfortable with me speaking this freely
[Fri May 27 2022 23:17:40]Muxto#8483 said: No, not at all
[Fri May 27 2022 23:17:45]Muxto#8483 said: just feels a bit weird
[Fri May 27 2022 23:17:46]Muxto#8483 said: Xd
[Fri May 27 2022 23:17:48]Muxto#8483 said: also...
[Fri May 27 2022 23:18:08]Muxto#8483 said: since they're all Reddit posts being fetched, their titles are links to the original posts
[Fri May 27 2022 23:18:20]LolQuattro#0125 said: I’ve decided that I’m not going to care what others think anymore if I’m to become an alpha
[Fri May 27 2022 23:18:30]Muxto#8483 said: so if you end up with a post you'd like to see the comments of, you can just hit the title
[Fri May 27 2022 23:18:36]Muxto#8483 said: oh, alright
[Fri May 27 2022 23:18:49]Muxto#8483 said: if I go alpha, I become a monster 🥴
[Fri May 27 2022 23:18:55]Muxto#8483 said: that's why I try to control myself
[Fri May 27 2022 23:19:01]LolQuattro#0125 said: That’s the point fool
[Fri May 27 2022 23:19:09]LolQuattro#0125 said: Become a monster and then control it
[Fri May 27 2022 23:19:15]LolQuattro#0125 said: That’s what an alpha is
[Fri May 27 2022 23:19:22]Muxto#8483 said: ooooooo

[Fri May 27 2022 23:20:08]LolQuattro#0125 said: I would send you a video but I know you’re not gonna watch it so there’s no point
[Fri May 27 2022 23:20:11]Muxto#8483 said: for example, you can click/tap on the title to visit the original post on Reddit
[Fri May 27 2022 23:20:22]Muxto#8483 said: what kind of video? Motivational?
[Fri May 27 2022 23:20:37]Muxto#8483 said: Workout? Or.... NSFW? 🥴

[Sat May 28 2022 17:39:09]Muxto#8483 said: I'm not making this data public anyways
[Sat May 28 2022 17:39:21]LolQuattro#0125 said: To see your reaction
[Sat May 28 2022 17:39:28]LolQuattro#0125 said: I was waiting when you’d show me that lol
[Sat May 28 2022 17:40:03]Muxto#8483 said: I see. And I was wondering whether I should interfere or not. I thought if I told you about it, you would stop using the bot entirely. So I was quiet to see how far this goes! XD
[Sat May 28 2022 17:40:44]LolQuattro#0125 said: Lol remember when I said I don’t care what others think
[Sat May 28 2022 17:40:49]LolQuattro#0125 said: Exactly that
[Sat May 28 2022 17:41:04]LolQuattro#0125 said: I’ll still use it as long as the feature is there 👍
[Sat May 28 2022 17:41:24]Muxto#8483 said: oh really? What "others" think? You realize that includes the public as well? 😆
[Sat May 28 2022 17:41:42]Muxto#8483 said: yeah, it'll be there, as long as Reddit is there
[Sat May 28 2022 17:42:06]LolQuattro#0125 said: If someone asks me such questions I’ll answer honestly
[Sat May 28 2022 17:42:10]LolQuattro#0125 said: That’s that
[Sat May 28 2022 17:42:14]Muxto#8483 said: hmmm

[Sat May 28 2022 17:53:37]Muxto#8483 said: also... it's a really bad idea to do this on the bot dev himself 🙂 😂
[Sat May 28 2022 17:53:51]Muxto#8483 said: also... I don't care, 'cause I have an infinite supply of daycoins
[Sat May 28 2022 17:54:41]LolQuattro#0125 said: Lol

**Daycoins :** can be earned, transferred. Used for paid services (will add soon).
**Nytecoins :** can only be earned through Patreon memberships or as special rewards. Used for the coolest services <@977262952354828308> can provide. Can be redeemed into 1000 Daycoins

[Sat May 28 2022 18:30:59]Muxto#8483 said: particularly, 'cause the bot cannot go large scale too suddenly
[Sat May 28 2022 18:31:16]Muxto#8483 said: might end up with lots of glitches in large servers or too many servers 🥴

[Sat May 28 2022 19:32:37]Muxto#8483 said: the tragedies of copy-pasting 😓
[Sat May 28 2022 19:33:25]Muxto#8483 said: By copy-paste, I mean within the code. For these features, I'm programming them all from scratch
[Sat May 28 2022 19:33:38]Muxto#8483 said: 'cause there weren't any public templates 🥲
[Sat May 28 2022 19:34:07]Muxto#8483 said: anyways... it's a good thing. I'm building this bot from the ground up.

[Sun May 29 2022 21:30:29]LolQuattro#0125 said: That’s an issue with you 😅
[Sun May 29 2022 21:30:35]LolQuattro#0125 said: Focus on this current bot at hand
[Sun May 29 2022 21:30:47]DMukto#8483 said: I mean... that bot could pull in some traffic
[Sun May 29 2022 21:30:51]LolQuattro#0125 said: Make other bots after this one fully complete
[Sun May 29 2022 21:31:11]DMukto#8483 said: the thing is..... <@977262952354828308> will never be complete!

[Sun May 29 2022 21:32:27]DMukto#8483 said: I first thought Dolly would be complete by just having some music features
[Sun May 29 2022 21:32:27]DMukto#8483 said: but then I added more!
[Sun May 29 2022 21:32:36]LolQuattro#0125 said: Ah okay
[Sun May 29 2022 21:33:06]DMukto#8483 said: I also wanted to make something related to cars
[Sun May 29 2022 21:33:12]DMukto#8483 said: a type of racing game using a bot
[Sun May 29 2022 21:33:27]DMukto#8483 said: but haven't found a way to make it interesting or cool 🤷‍♂️
[Sun May 29 2022 21:33:40]DMukto#8483 said: if your mind captures any ideas, lemme know!
[Sun May 29 2022 21:34:00]DMukto#8483 said: You'll be credited appropriately
