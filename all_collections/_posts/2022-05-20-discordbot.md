Hey there! You must be here for witnessing any news about my latest invention, MuxDay the Discord bot!

Unfortunately, I am still busy setting things up on my end for this virtual Discord fox.

So far, I was struggling to troubleshoot and patch up lots of errors. Particularly, today was my first day handling NodeJS from scratch. I mainly tried to migrate some of the previous plugins for my bots written in Python to NodeJS. And boy, o boy! Took me more than 4 hours to get the fair basics completed. Anyways, I'm glad that things are going the way I expected them... at the cost of time and mental strain!

For me, my personal achievement was when I finally got the buttons right.

This webpage will be updated with any new features or improvements. Most importantly, you'll know when it will be ready for public usage! At the moment, only a few servers and users have been authorized to beta test the bot out on my behalf. If you're one of those lucky folk by any chance, then I thank you for visiting this website.

Alright, you know what? Go ahead and invite the bot to your server. Remove any permissions which you believe are not necessary.

Stay tuned!
