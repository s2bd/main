## About
This webpage will be updated with any new features or improvements. Most importantly, you'll know when it will be ready for public usage! At the moment, only a few servers and users have been authorized to beta test the bot out on my behalf. If you're one of those lucky folk by any chance, then I thank you for visiting this website.

Alright, you know what? Go ahead and invite the bot to your server. Remove any permissions which you believe are not necessary.

Previously, MuxDay had music features built into it. But now [MuxMusic](https://muxworks.com/musicbot) has them all.

So far, I was struggling to troubleshoot and patch up lots of errors. Particularly, 20th May 2022 was my first day handling NodeJS from scratch. I mainly tried to migrate some of the previous plugins for my bots written in Python to NodeJS. And boy, o boy! Took me more than 4 hours to get the fair basics completed. Anyways, I'm glad that things are going the way I expected them... at the cost of time and mental strain!

## Devlog
```
✔️ 20 May 2022 : Development started. Fierce programming in progress. Managed to create buttons using DiscordJS v13.
✔️ 21 May 2022 : Began implementing music commands. Was programming for more than 10 hours. Result not complete yet.
✔️ 22 May 2022 : Success! Music features are now available. But I still gotta find a way to reduce latency to improve the bitrate.
✔️ 23 May 2022 : Decided to switch to a different bot for all of MuxDay's music features. Designed new logos using Canva.
✔️ 24 May 2022 : Set up a new website for MuxMusic. Spent majority of today's time working on that.
✔️ 26 May 2022 : New feature for MuxDay that auto-deletes any messages containing unknown links.
🔥 27 May 2022 : New meme/image fetching features for MuxDay.
```
Stay tuned!
